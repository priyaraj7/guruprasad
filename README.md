# GURUPRASAD - RESTAURANT MENU APP

Pandemic and the nationwide lock-down have affected the restaurant industry badly. Most of the restaurants shut down during the pandemic. I was inspired by my uncleâ€™s hardship during the lock-down with his restaurant in India. This app is for my uncle to show how he can make use of technology and increase his businesses revenue.

First you need to create an [Auth0 API](https://auth0.com/), [Google Place API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview).

Clone the restaurant menu repository

```

Next move into the server and install dependencies and start the server

```

Create a `.env` file and enter your api-key. You can refer `.env-example` file.

Using this command, restore the Postgres Database

```bash
psql postgres -f db.sql
```

Open another terminal then cd into the client, install dependencies and start the server

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Create a .env file and enter your Auth0 credential.
