# GURUPRASAD - RESTAURANT MENU APP

Pandemic and the nationwide lock-down have affected the restaurant industry badly. Most of the restaurants shut down during the pandemic. I was inspired by my uncleâ€™s hardship during the lock-down with his restaurant in India. This app is for my uncle to show how he can make use of technology and increase his businesses revenue.
